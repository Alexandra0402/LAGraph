Demo programs that use LAGraph and GraphBLAS
to run all of the GAP Benchmark problems.

FIXME: currently requires SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS v5.0.3 or later,
    with LG_VANILLA undefined or set to -DLG_VANILLA=1.

FIXME: scripts have hard-coded paths for the GAP matrices

FIXME: scripts also have a hardcoded path the executable:
    ../../build/src/demo/bfs_demo for example

FIXME: describe how to get the GAP matrices from sparse.tamu.edu
    (as MM tar.gz files), then how to use do_gap_binary to create
    the binary .grb files
