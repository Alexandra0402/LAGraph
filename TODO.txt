TODO: add interfaces to external packages.

    GTgraph: (Madduri and Bader) for generating synthetic graphs
    CSparse or CXSparse (for depth-first search, scc, dmperm, amd,
        in the sequential case)
    graph partitioning: METIS, Mongoose, etc
    others?

TODO: interfaces to:
    MATLAB interface
    Python interface, etc.
