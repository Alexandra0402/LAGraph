As of Nov 18, 2021:

    * test LG_VANILLA
    * consider testing, documenting, polishing all experimental algorithms &
      utilities
    * need vanilla connected components
    * unify error return values as much as possible, now that v2.0 C API
        has assigned enum values to GrB_Info
    * index ramp in vanilla BFS
    * many TODOs and FIXMEs throughout
    * reduce the number of #include files and fix CMakeLists.txt so internal
        ones are not copied to /usr/local/include on "sudo make install"
    * remove experimental/test/old or move to old/test
    * remove experimental/utility/old or move to old/utility
    * remove src/algorithm/old
