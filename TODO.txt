TODO, SPEC: all enum values in the spec should be defined.  They are not, so as
a result, a user code cannot be linked against an arbitrary GraphBLAS library
after it is compiled.  It must be linked with the same GraphBLAS library it is
compiled with.  SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS defines all user-visible enum values
explicitly.  See the SuiteSparse/Include/GraphBLAS.h.   Note that I have
added a GxB_DEFAULT = 0 to the descriptor enum, GrB_Desc_Value (otherwise,
there is no way to set a descriptor value to its default value).  Otherwise,
I have numbered them in the order they appear in the tables in the spec,
starting with zero.

TODO: the following methods require GxB_Matrix_type:
./Source/Utility/LAGraph_ispattern.c
./Source/Utility/LAGraph_mmwrite.c
./Source/Utility/LAGraph_isequal.c
