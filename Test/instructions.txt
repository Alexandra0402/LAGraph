To run all of the GAP benchmarks on the Intel DevCloud:

Edit your .bash_profile, assuming you put GraphBLAS and LAGraph in $HOME:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/bin:$HOME/GraphBLAS/build:$HOME/LAGraph/build
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Download GraphBLAS and LAGraph to $HOME, side-by-side (not one inside the
other):

    git clone -b master https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS
    git clone https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph

You should have two folders, ~/GraphBLAS and ~/LAGraph, side-by-side.

For GraphBLAS, sometimes the latest version on the non-default MASTER
branch is non-functional; you may want to use a tagged pre-release instead:
See https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS/releases .
So please ask me first (email: davis@tamu.edu), just in case.

Next, submit this to compile GraphBLAS and LAGraph (see contents below):

    qsub myjob_compile_plat_gcc

myjob_compile_plat_gcc contains the following:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=2:plat8153
    #PBS -l walltime=24:00:00
    cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
    cd GraphBLAS
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../LAGraph
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd Test/BinRead
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../BetweennessCentrality
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../BFS
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../CC
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../PageRank3
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../TriangleCount
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    cd ../SSSP
    make CC=gcc CXX=gcc JOBS=24
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that will break if you do not have the m4 command.

DO NOT USE icc; IT WILL GIVE POOR PERFORMANCE, because of how it does atomics.
I'm exploring workarounds.  Probably can use this in
GraphBLAS/Source/GB_atomics.h: 

    #define GB_ATOMIC_READ
    #define GB_ATOMIC_WRITE

instead of the current:

    #define GB_ATOMIC_READ    GB_PRAGMA (omp atomic read)
    #define GB_ATOMIC_WRITE   GB_PRAGMA (omp atomic write)

Then I think icc should be fast.

You then need to convert the *mtx files to GraphBLAS binary *grb files for
faster I/O times.  My scripts assume the matrices are in ~/GAP/GAP-xxx/*.*
where xxx is kron, road, twitter, urand, or web.  Cut-and-paste the following,
just once:

    cd
    mkdir GAP
    mkdir GAP/GAP-kron
    mkdir GAP/GAP-urand
    mkdir GAP/GAP-twitter
    mkdir GAP/GAP-web
    mkdir GAP/GAP-road
    cp /data/sparse.tamu.edu/gap/GAP-kron/GAP-kron_sources.mtx ~/GAP/GAP-kron
    cp /data/sparse.tamu.edu/gap/GAP-road/GAP-road_sources.mtx ~/GAP/GAP-road
    cp /data/sparse.tamu.edu/gap/GAP-twitter/GAP-twitter_sources.mtx ~/GAP/GAP-twitter
    cp /data/sparse.tamu.edu/gap/GAP-urand/GAP-urand_sources.mtx ~/GAP/GAP-web
    cp /data/sparse.tamu.edu/gap/GAP-web/GAP-web_sources.mtx ~/GAP/GAP-road
    cd LAGraph/Test/BinRead
    qsub myjob_BinRead_gold

When that finishes, run the tests.  All the qsub scripts are already in the
LAGraph github.  You should be able to cut-and-paste these commands to run all
the scripts.  For the output, see the Test/*/myjob*.o* files that the scripts
generate.

    cd LAGraph/Test
    cd BetweennessCentrality
    qsub my1_BC_plat
    qsub my2_BC_plat
    cd ../BFS
    qsub my1_BFS_plat
    qsub my2_BFS_plat
    cd ../CC
    qsub my1_CC_plat
    qsub my2_CC_plat
    cd ../PageRank3
    qsub my1_PR_plat
    qsub my2_PR_plat
    cd ../SSSP
    qsub my1_SSSP_plat
    qsub my2_SSSP_plat
    cd ../TriangleCount
    qsub my1_TC_plat
    qsub my2_TC_plat

Those run the 2 sets: "default" (set 1, the my1* jobs), and "best effort" (the
my2* jobs).  You can also try the */my3_*_plat jobs, which use all default
settings (including # of threads, with hyperthreading enabled by default).
This will use whatever threads you have as the max, then it runs again with 1/2
that number.

Each test result will be placed in a file in each
test folder, as it completes, with the name log_HOST.txt, where
HOST is the hostname of the system that was used.
