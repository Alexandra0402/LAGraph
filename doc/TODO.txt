As of Nov 30, 2021:

    * test, document, polish all experimental algorithms & utilities
    * unify error return values as much as possible, now that v2.0 C API
        has assigned enum values to GrB_Info
    * many TODOs and FIXMEs throughout
    * CC: needs new GxB_select with rank operator, and GxB_extract
    * brutal memory testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE:

TODO: need GrB_Matrix_type or type_name.  use GxB_Matrix_type_name instead
    of GxB_Matrix_type.
    (type query needs to be added to the GraphBLAS API Specification)

TODO: add interfaces to external packages.

    GTgraph: (Madduri and Bader) for generating synthetic graphs
    CSparse or CXSparse (for depth-first search, scc, dmperm, amd,
        in the sequential case)
    graph partitioning: METIS, Mongoose, etc
    others?

TODO: interfaces to:
    MATLAB interface
    Python interface, etc.

TODO: need more algorithms and utilities

TODO: move LICENSE, etc to Doc/
