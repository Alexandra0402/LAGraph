As of Nov 19, 2021:

    * consider testing, documenting, polishing all experimental algorithms &
      utilities
    * need vanilla connected components
    * unify error return values as much as possible, now that v2.0 C API
        has assigned enum values to GrB_Info
    * many TODOs and FIXMEs throughout

TODO: for v1.0 release

    documentation
    testing
    error return values
    lots of TODOs in CC method (connected components): Ariful working on it
    vanilla CC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE:
TODO: need GrB_Matrix_type or type_name.  use GxB_Matrix_type_name instead
    of GxB_Matrix_type.
    (type query needs to be added to the GraphBLAS API Specification)

TODO: add interfaces to external packages.

    GTgraph: (Madduri and Bader) for generating synthetic graphs
    CSparse or CXSparse (for depth-first search, scc, dmperm, amd,
        in the sequential case)
    graph partitioning: METIS, Mongoose, etc
    others?

TODO: interfaces to:
    MATLAB interface
    Python interface, etc.

TODO: need more algorithms and utilities

TODO: move LICENSE, etc to Doc/
