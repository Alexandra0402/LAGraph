As of Jan 26, 2022:

    * LAGraph_MMRead: add "type" to %%GraphBLAS

    * entire user guide
        experimental -> src, how to do it.
        HTML vs PDF vs ... link into PDF ...
        write it in LaTeX
        also update top-level README.txt

    * test, document, polish all src & experimental: algorithms, utilities,
        and tests.
        as of Jan 12: testing is at 95%.  Only untested functions are
        4 experimental/algorithms: lcc, cdlp, scc, and msf.

    * unify error return values as much as possible, now that v2.0 C API
        has assigned enum values to GrB_Info.  Suggest we use GrB_Info
        values, as ints, as much as possible
        TODO: use LG_ASSERT as much as possible, instead of LG_CHECK
            (almost done)
        TODO: use LG_TRY (LAGraph_...(...,msg)) not LG_CHECK,
            when calling LAGraph method from LAGraph methods.
            (done?)

        GrB_OUT_OF_MEMORY
        GrB_NULL_POINTER
        ...

    * many TODOs and FIXMEs throughout

    * SSSP: allow it to work on any matrix type (currently just INT32)

    * Triangle count: use an enum for selecting the method, and for presort

    * check function names and API (LAGraph_IsEqual for GrB_Matrix, and
        LAGraph_Vector_IsEqual for GrB_Vectors for example,
        but LAGraph_Matrix_print and LAGraph_Vector_print)

    * missing features:

        * file I/O with a common, binary, non-opaque format that all
            GraphBLAS libraries can read.  Ideally using compression
            (see SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS uses LZ4 for its GrB_Matrix_serialize/
            deserialize and it would not be hard to add LZ4 to LAGraph).

    * move LICENSE, etc to doc/ ?

    * delete BENCHMARK_INSTRUCTIONS__README1st.txt for v1.0

    * add names to Contributors.txt

    * delete old/ folder

    * clean up src/benchmark (old output files)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE: can we exploit asynch algorithms? C += A*C for example?
        Gauss-Seidel, Afforest, etc?  I can do it in GraphBLAS; can LAGraph
        use it?

FUTURE:

    * need new GxB methods in GraphBLAS for CC, ideally for v1.0 of LAGraph:
        GxB_select with GxB_RankUnaryOp, and GxB_extract with GrB_Vectors as
        inputs instead of (GrB_Index *) arrays.

FUTURE: add interfaces to external packages.

    GTgraph: (Madduri and Bader) for generating synthetic graphs
    CSparse or CXSparse (for depth-first search, scc, dmperm, amd,
        in the sequential case)
    graph partitioning: METIS, Mongoose, etc
    SuiteSparse solvers (UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, KLU, SPQR, ...)
    others?

FUTURE: interfaces to MATLAB, Python, Julia, etc.

FUTURE: need more algorithms and utilities
